# Pythia React Coding Test

Develop a simple stock watchlist app, using React, with TypeScript (preferably) or JavaScript, that meets the following requirements:
- Similar to https://finance.yahoo.com/most-active/, show the last traded **price**, **change**, **% change**, **volume**, but also the last **timestamp**, flashing the updated values whenever they are updated.
- Use the live market data from Yahoo! Finance, subscribing to updates via their WebSocket, for the following symbols: SPY, TSLA, APPL, AMZN, MSFT, META, GOOG, AMD, INTC and NVDA.

There are no requirements in terms of user interface design, but you should strive to build something not only functional and performant, but also aesthetically pleasing. Use the opportunity to show your UI and UX design skills!
